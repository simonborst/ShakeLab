UDP Telemetry Bass Shaker Control Software

This is open source software for controlling bass shakers for haptic feedback. I recently started working on this to use for my simulator. Run main.py in python, and you can try it for yourself. Currently the only implemented game is F1 23.

When selecting audio device, I highly recommend using selections with WASAPI drivers (you should see this in the dropdown as an option). This will provide much lower latency than some of the other options. The main goal I had when starting this project was to lower the latency of the haptic feedback on my setup. This program has helped greatly with this.
